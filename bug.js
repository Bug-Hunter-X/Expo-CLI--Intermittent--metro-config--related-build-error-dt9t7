While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the 'metro-config' package. The error message wasn't specific, but it prevented the app from starting. The project was using several Expo modules that were properly installed and linked, so a basic dependency issue was ruled out. The problem was intermittent and didn't appear consistently across builds, suggesting a more subtle issue.
