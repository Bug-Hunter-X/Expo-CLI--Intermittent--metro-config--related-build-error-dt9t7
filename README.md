This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo CLI.  The bug manifests as an intermittent build failure, seemingly related to the 'metro-config' package.  The error message provides little diagnostic information. The bugSolution.js file contains a potential workaround that addresses the issue in some cases.  This issue may be related to caching, specific module interactions, or other underlying Expo CLI processes. Contributions to identify the root cause and a more robust solution are welcome.
